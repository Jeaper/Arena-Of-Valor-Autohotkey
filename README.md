# Arena-Of-Valor-Autohotkey

Autohotkey script for allowing the use of a controller (via bluestacks on pc) to aim and cast spells in the game.

The way you aim and cast is you press the button for the spell, which activates the aiming, your mouse cursor will be restricted inside the ability circle (Move it with your right joystick), press it again to cast it.

Check the script for editable values, should be pretty clear.

I use steam as a keybinder.
Just go into big picture mode and configure desktop controls

My steam keybinds:
